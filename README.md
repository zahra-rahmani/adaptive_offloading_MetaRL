# Adaptive Offloading Using Meta Reinforcement Learning (MetaRL)

This project focuses on implementing an adaptive task offloading system using Meta Reinforcement Learning (MetaRL). The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of edge computing environments by dynamically optimizing the offloading process. 

Key features include the ability to adapt to changing network conditions, improve resource utilization, and minimize latency and energy consumption. The project evaluates the system's performance under various scenarios, providing insights into the benefits of MetaRL-based offloading strategies.
